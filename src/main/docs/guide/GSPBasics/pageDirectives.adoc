GSP also supports a few JSP-style page directives.

The import directive lets you import classes into the page. However, it is rarely needed due to Groovy's default imports and xref:tags.adoc[GSP Tags]:

[,xml]
----
<%@ page import="java.awt.*" %>
----

GSP also supports the contentType directive:

[,xml]
----
<%@ page contentType="application/json" %>
----

The contentType directive allows using GSP to render other formats.
