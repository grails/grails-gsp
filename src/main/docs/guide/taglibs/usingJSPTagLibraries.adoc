In addition to the simplified tag library mechanism provided by GSP, you can also use JSP tags from GSP.

In order to use JSP support you must ensure you have the `grails-web-jsp` dependency on your classpath by adding it to your `build.gradle` file:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    //...
    runtimeOnly "org.grails:grails-web-jsp:{version}"
}
----


Then you will need to declare the JSP taglib to use with the `taglib` directive at the top of your GSP file:

[,xml]
----
<%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" %>
----

Besides this you have to configure Grails to scan for the JSP tld files.
This is configured with the `grails.gsp.tldScanPattern` setting. It accepts a comma separated String value. Spring's PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver is used to resolve the patterns.

For example, you could scan for all available tld files by adding this to `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
grails:
    gsp:
        tldScanPattern: 'classpath*:/META-INF/*.tld,/WEB-INF/tld/*.tld'
----

JSTL standard library is no longer added as a dependency by default. In case you are using JSTL, you should also add these dependencies to `build.gradle`:
[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    //...
    runtimeOnly 'javax.servlet:jstl:1.1.2'
    runtimeOnly 'taglibs:standard:1.1.2'
}
----

Then you can use JSP tags like any other tag:

[source,xml]
----
<fmt:formatNumber value="${10}" pattern=".00"/>
----

With the added bonus that you can invoke JSP tags like methods:

[source,gsp]
----
${fmt.formatNumber(value:10, pattern:".00")}
----
